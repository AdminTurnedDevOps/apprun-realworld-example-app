This codebase was created to demonstrate application frontend built with **[AppRun](https://github.com/yysun/apprun)** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) community style guides & best practices.
